# Quotopia
Qutopia is a random quote generator API that leverages Express.js, Node.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS to provide a seamless and intelligent code generation experience. The project is structured with two main folders: `client` and `server`. The client folder contains the React.js frontend, designed with Tailwind CSS, while the server folder houses the Node.js backend implemented with Express.js. The primary functionality of the API is to fetch random quotes from a quotes.json file.
